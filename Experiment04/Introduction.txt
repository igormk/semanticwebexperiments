This experiment tests the performaces of the reasoner. An ontology model was created
which tried to test the limits of the reasoner. The ontology consists of classes
which are connected to each other with the subClassOf property. There are N rows, each
row has N classes. We can think of the layout of the model as a matrix. Every class,
except the classes in the highest level have two superclasses above them. The classes
in the lowest layer additionally have one individual each. This interconnected network
of classes can be seen on the picture graph.jpg.
The query which was tested is "How many individuals have the classes in the most upper
layer" keeping in mind that the inheritance property is applied, that means class A which have
subclasses contains not only the individuals that are instances of this class A, but
individuals from the classes which are subclasses of this class A.
