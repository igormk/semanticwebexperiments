The results were as expected. There can be around 200,000 resources loaded
into memory. A bit suprising result was that length of path name has a big
influence in the size of the resouce as a whole. Two types of string name
were used, a string name with 35 letters and a string name with 70 letters.
The results are as shown:

219774 Classes with NS having 35 letters
158850 Classes with NS having 70 letters

225198 Properties with NS having 35 letters
173227 Properties with NS having 70 letters

225206 Individuals with NS having 35 letters
173235 Individuals with NS having 70 letters

We can see that most amount of memory is used by Class. We can also see how
big is the difference of extreme value of total number of classes in the two
cases. Increasing of 100% of the string length size results in increasing
the total memory size taken by the class in about 35%. By using simple math, we
can get an approximate view of how big is the amount of memory used by the resource.

Hypotesis: the memory size of the string is the length of the string * 1 Byte
219774 * (memorynostring + 35 Bytes) = 158850 * (memorynostring + 70 Bytes)
60924 * memorynostring = 11119500 Bytes - 7692090 Bytes = 3427410 Bytes
memorynostring = 57 Bytes

These are only experimental results.
