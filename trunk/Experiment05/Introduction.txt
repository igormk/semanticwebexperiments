We try to find the upper number of classes that can be placed in the same
ontology in the same time which can be successfully loaded into memory.
Also we try to find the upper number of other elements, Properties and
Individuals. Also we are testing how big influence has the class path
in the total number of resources, how much the extreme value will be changed
with shorter and with longer path name.
