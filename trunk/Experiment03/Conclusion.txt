The first file that was tested was amino-acid.owl which is
described in the Introduction file. The program was executed a couple
of times and with two different values for the number of statements, 1000
and 3,000. This was because of two reasons. Firstly, executing statements
with index over 3,800 was impossible, the program throw exceptions. This was
I guess from two reasons, the data was not ok, or the reasoning system did not
function correctly. However the experiment continued. Seond thing, we want to get
as accurate data as possible, and if the values for two upper limits vere similar
then we can get more accurate conclusion. The data obtained is:

1000 (without printing to System.out)

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 872 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 217 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,020 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,128 miliseconds

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 858 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 206 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,019 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,138 miliseconds

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 876 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 227 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,026 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,131 miliseconds


3000 (without printing to System.out)

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 942 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 215 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,038 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,290 miliseconds

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 880 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 206 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,038 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,295 miliseconds

START OF READING amino-acid.owl
The file was read in 892 miliseconds
The inference model was created in 207 miliseconds
Average time for finding a statement is 0,039 miliseconds
Average time for executing a query is 0,286 miliseconds

We can see that the model was loaded in reasonable time, around 1 second, also
the inference model was build relatively fast. The time for finding a statement is
different from the time for executing a query because the system has it's own
algorithm how to find the next statement and on the path of doing that
uses already made calculations from before, so the average time for finding a statement is
a couple of times smaller than the average time for executing a query built on statement.
We can notice that the average time for executing a query is not the same for the two different
upper limits. Unfortunatelly this fact doesn't help us in making final conclusion.
The difference in times can be easily explained. The system uses its own algorithm for finding
statements so at start it finds the statements which are easier to find, then the more
complex ones, so the order is important here. From the tested maximum number of statements
(1,000 and 3,000) we can conclude that the average time for executing a query varies from
0.1 to 0.3 miliseconds. However this are not so realiable results.
