The first thing that was tested was the upper limit - the number of
resources that can be put in series for which the program can give
the appropriate conclusion. Suprisingly, the upper limit of N is realively low.
For values above 2,000 the program fails. THe ontology is built but the
program fails on heapspace needed for generating the conclusion about
the inheritance. A chart included in this folder chart_01.jpg shows
the data taken from one instance of this experiment. Other text files
are included in this folder too which are used to make the final conclusion.
The apscise of the chart shows the variable (N/10). The ordinate shows the
elapsed time in miliseconds (the value t4-t3 in the program). We can see that
for values of N smaller than 2,000 the line is nearly a straight line
and time = c * N where c is a constant. Near values of N the time rapidly
increases. This is mainly by the big ammount of memory which is used by the
program. For values above 2,000 the program fails.
