This experiment is testing the performances of the system which is
trying to make conclusion about the relations between two resources.
Resources are connected with the property SubClassOf. We are testing the
transitive property of the ontology.
We have N resources in order, each resource is subclass of another resource,
so it is like resources are connected in a list
A subclass of B subclass of C sublass of D sublass of ... sublass of Z
We are testing the time needed the system to conclude that A is subclass of Z.
The number N of elements in the list is varying, and time is calculated in two most
important phases, first one - creating the ontology and second one - derivating the
conclusing about the inheritance.
The first phase is system dependent so the results about this time can be ignored.
